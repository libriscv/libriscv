# RISC-V sandboxing library

_libriscv_ is a simple, slim and complete sandbox that is highly embeddable and configurable. It is a specialty emulator that specializes in low-latency, low-footprint emulation. _libriscv_ may be the only one of its kind. Where other solutions routinely require ~50-150ns to call a VM function and return, _libriscv_ requires 3ns. _libriscv_ is also routinely faster than other interpreters, JIT-compilers and binary translators. _libriscv_ has specialized APIs that make passing data in and out of the sandbox safe and low-latency.

There is also [a CLI](/emulator) that you can use to run RISC-V programs and step through instructions one by one, like a simulator, or to connect with GDB in order to remotely live-debug programs. The CLI has many build and run-time options, so please check out [the README](/emulator/README.md).

## Ultra-Low latency emulation

_libriscv_ is an ultra-low latency emulator, designed specifically to have very low overheads when sandboxing certain programs, such as game scripts. All the listed goals reflect current implementation.

Goals:
- Lowest possible latency
	- Calling a guest VM function can finish 1-2 orders of magnitude before other emulators begin executing the first instruction
- Lightning-fast interpreter mode
- Modern, type-safe VM call and system call interfaces
	- The safe interfaces prevents all kinds of footguns that the author has personally suffered, and consequently blocked off forever :-)
- [Secure speculation-safe sandbox](SECURITY.md)
- Low attack surface, only 20k LOC
- Platform-independent and super-easy to embed
	- Supports all architectures and all platforms, C++17 or later
- Pause and resume is a first-class citizen
	- Pause on any instruction
	- Make preemptive function calls
	- Pause and serialize VM, deserialize and resume on another host/platform
- Just-in-time compilation for development usage
	- [libtcc](#embedded-libtcc) can be used to instantly improve emulation of RISC-V programs
	- This is currently enabled by default
- High-performance binary translation on end-user systems through DLLs (eg. Windows)
	- Cross-compile RISC-V programs to a [binary translated](#binary-translation) .dll executable in _libriscv_ on end-user systems (where shared libraries are allowed)
- Maximum final-build performance on all platforms, including Consoles, Mobiles, production systems
	- Supports [embeddable](#full-binary-translation-as-embeddable-code) high-performance binary translations that can be baked into final builds (eg. where shared libraries are not allowed, or static builds are preferred)
- Tiny memory footprint
	- Less than 40kB total memory usage for [fibonacci program](/binaries/measure_mips/fib.c)
- High scalability with unique CoW-support and shared memories
	- Serve requests using ephemeral VMs in [~1us in production](https://github.com/libriscv/drogon-sandbox)
	- Execute segments are automatically shared among all instances (with or without forking)
- Dynamic linking and run-time dlopen() support (see CLI)
- Supports sandboxing language-runtimes that use JIT-compilation, eg. V8 JavaScript and LuaJIT
	- JIT-compiled segments will be detected, processed and can use the fast-path dispatch

Non goals:
- Wide support for Linux system calls
- Higher performance at the cost of call latency

## Benchmarks

[STREAM benchmark](https://gist.github.com/fwsGonzo/a594727a9429cb29f2012652ad43fb37) [CoreMark: 38223](https://gist.github.com/fwsGonzo/7ef100ba4fe7116e97ddb20cf26e6879) vs 41382 native (~92%).

Run [D00M 1 in libriscv](/examples/doom) and see for yourself. It should use around 2% CPU at 60 fps.

Benchmark between [binary translated libriscv vs LuaJIT](https://gist.github.com/fwsGonzo/9132f0ef7d3f009baa5b222eedf392da), [interpreted libriscv vs LuaJIT](https://gist.github.com/fwsGonzo/1af5b2a9b4f38c1f3d3074d78acdf609) and also [interpreted libriscv vs Luau](https://gist.github.com/fwsGonzo/5ac8f4d8ca84e97b0c527aec76a86fe9).  Most benchmarks are hand-picked for the purposes of game engine scripting, but there are still some classic benchmarks.

  ### Benchmarks against other emulators
  RISC-V is a register machine architecture, which makes it very easy to reach good interpreter performance without needing a register allocator.

  We can see that _libriscv_ in interpreter mode is substantially faster than other interpreters.

  _libriscv_ can call the above function 5.25-7.25 times before _wasmtime_ has called it once. _libriscv_ beats all established emulators for short-running functions due to its substantially lower latency.

## Embedding the emulator in a project

See the [example project](/examples/embed) for directly embedding libriscv using CMake. You can also use libriscv as a packaged artifact, through the [package example](/examples/package), although you will need to install [the package](/.github/workflows/packaging.yml) first.

On Windows you can use Clang-cl in Visual Studio. See the [example CMake project](/examples/msvc). It requires Clang and Git installed.


## Emulator using Docker CLI

```sh
docker build . -t libriscv
docker run -v $PWD/binaries:/app/binaries --rm -i -t libriscv binaries/<binary>
```

A fib(256000000) program for testing is built automatically. You can test-run it like so:
```sh
docker run -v $PWD/binaries:/app/binaries --rm -i -t libriscv fib
```

You can enter the docker container instead of using it from the outside. A 64-bit RISC-V compiler is installed in the container, and it can be used to build RISC-V programs.

```sh
docker run -v $PWD/binaries:/app/binaries --entrypoint='' -i -t libriscv /bin/bash
```

Inside the container you have access to `rvlinux`, and the compilers `riscv64-linux-gnu-gcc-13` and `riscv64-linux-gnu-g++-13`. There is also `rvlinux-fast` which uses binary translation to make emulation a lot faster, but needs time to compile beforehand.


## Installing a RISC-V GCC compiler

On Ubuntu and Linux distributions like it, you can install a 64-bit RISC-V GCC compiler for running Linux programs with a one-liner:

```
sudo apt install gcc-14-riscv64-linux-gnu g++-14-riscv64-linux-gnu
```

Depending on your distro you may have access to GCC versions 10 to 14. Now you have a full Linux C/C++ compiler for 64-bit RISC-V.

To build smaller and leaner programs you will want a (limited) Linux userspace environment. Check out the guide on how to [build a Newlib compiler](/docs/NEWLIB.md).

## Running a RISC-V program

```sh
cd emulator
./build.sh
./rvlinux <path to RISC-V ELF binary>
```

Check out the [CLI documentation](/emulator/README.md).

## Remote debugging using GDB

If you have built the emulator, you can use `./rvlinux --gdb /path/to/program` to enable GDB to connect. Most distros have `gdb-multiarch`, which is a separate program from the default gdb. It will have RISC-V support already built in. Start your GDB like so: `gdb-multiarch /path/to/program`. Make sure your program is built with -O0 and with debuginfo present. Then, once in GDB connect with `target remote :2159`. Now you can step through the code.

Most modern languages embed their own pretty printers for debuginfo which enables you to go line by line in your favorite language.

## Instruction set support

The emulator currently supports the RVA22U64 profile. More specifically, RV32GCB, RV64GCB (imafdc_zicsr_zifence_zicond_zba_zbb_zbc_zbs) and RV128G.
The A-, F-, D-, C- and B-extensions should be 100% supported on 32- and 64-bit. V-extension is undergoing work.

The 128-bit ISA support is experimental, and the specification is not yet complete.

## Example usage when embedded into a project

Load a Linux program built for RISC-V and run through main:
```C++
#include <libriscv/machine.hpp>

int main(int /*argc*/, const char** /*argv*/)
{
	// Load ELF binary from file
	const std::vector<uint8_t> binary /* = ... */;

	using namespace riscv;

	// Create a 64-bit machine (with default options, see: libriscv/common.hpp)
	Machine<RISCV64> machine { binary };

	// Add program arguments on the stack, and set a few basic
	// environment variables.
	machine.setup_linux(
		{"myprogram", "1st argument!", "2nd argument!"},
		{"LC_TYPE=C", "LC_ALL=C", "USER=groot"});

	// Add all the basic Linux system calls.
	// This includes `exit` and `exit_group` which we will override below.
	machine.setup_linux_syscalls();

	// Install our own `exit_group` system call handler (for all 64-bit machines).
	Machine<RISCV64>::install_syscall_handler(94, // exit_group
		[] (Machine<RISCV64>& machine) {
			const auto [code] = machine.sysarg <int> (0);
			printf(">>> Program exited, exit code = %d\n", code);
			machine.stop();
		});

	// This function will run until the exit syscall has stopped the
	// machine, an exception happens which stops execution, or the
	// instruction counter reaches the given 5bn instruction limit:
	try {
		machine.simulate(5'000'000'000ull);
	} catch (const std::exception& e) {
		fprintf(stderr, ">>> Runtime exception: %s\n", e.what());
	}
}
```

In order to have the machine not throw an exception when the instruction limit is reached, you can call simulate with the template argument false, instead:

```C++
machine.simulate<false>(5'000'000ull);
```
If the machine runs out of instructions, it will now simply stop running. Use `machine.instruction_limit_reached()` to check if the machine stopped running because it hit the instruction limit.

You can limit the amount of (virtual) memory the machine can use like so:
```C++
	const uint64_t memsize = 1024 * 1024 * 64ul;
	riscv::Machine<riscv::RISCV32> machine { binary, { .memory_max = memsize } };
```
You can find the `MachineOptions` structure in [common.hpp](/lib/libriscv/common.hpp).

You can find details on the Linux system call ABI online as well as in [the docs](/docs/SYSCALLS.md). You can use these examples to handle system calls in your RISC-V programs. The system calls emulate normal Linux system calls, and is compatible with a normal Linux RISC-V compiler.

## Example C API usage

Check out the [C API](/c/libriscv.h) and the [test project](/c/test/test.c).

## Handling instructions one by one

You can create your own custom instruction loop if you want to do things manually by yourself:

```C++
#include <libriscv/machine.hpp>
#include <libriscv/rv32i_instr.hpp>
...
Machine<RISCV64> machine{binary};
machine.setup_linux(
	{"myprogram"},
	{"LC_TYPE=C", "LC_ALL=C", "USER=root"});
machine.setup_linux_syscalls();

// Instruction limit is used to keep running
machine.set_max_instructions(50'000'000ull);

while (!machine.stopped()) {
	auto& cpu = machine.cpu;
	// Read next instruction
	const auto instruction = cpu.read_next_instruction();
	// Print the instruction to terminal
	printf("%s\n", cpu.to_string(instruction).c_str());
	// Execute instruction directly
	cpu.execute(instruction);
	// Increment PC to next instruction, and increment instruction counter
	cpu.increment_pc(instruction.length());
	machine.increment_counter(1);
}
```

## Pausing and resuming

Pausing and resuming is a first-class feature in libriscv. Using the same example as above with an additional outer loop, we can keep stopping as many times as we want to until the program ends normally.
```C++
	do {
		// Only execute 1000 instructions at a time
		machine.reset_instruction_counter();
		machine.set_max_instructions(1'000);

		while (!machine.stopped())
		{
			auto& cpu = machine.cpu;
			// Read next instruction
			const auto instruction = cpu.read_next_instruction();
			// Print the instruction to terminal
			printf("%s\n", cpu.to_string(instruction).c_str());
			// Execute instruction directly
			cpu.execute(instruction);
			// Increment PC to next instruction, and increment instruction counter
			cpu.increment_pc(instruction.length());
			machine.increment_counter(1);
		}

	} while (machine.instruction_limit_reached());
```
The function `machine.instruction_limit_reached()` only returns true when the instruction limit was reached, and not if the machine stops normally. Using that we can keep going until either the machine stops, or an exception is thrown.

## Setting up your own machine environment

You can create a machine without a binary, with no ELF loader invoked:

```C++
	Machine<RISCV32> machine;
	machine.setup_minimal_syscalls();

	std::vector<uint32_t> my_program {
		0x29a00513, //        li      a0,666
		0x05d00893, //        li      a7,93
		0x00000073, //        ecall
	};

	// Set main execute segment (12 instruction bytes)
	const uint32_t dst = 0x1000;
	machine.cpu.init_execute_area(my_program.data(), dst, 12);

	// Jump to the start instruction
	machine.cpu.jump(dst);

	// Geronimo!
	machine.simulate(1'000ull);
```

The fuzzing program does this, so have a look at that. There are also [unit tests](/tests/unit/micro.cpp).

## Adding your own instructions

See [this unit test](/tests/unit/custom.cpp) for an example on how to add your own instructions. They work in all simulation modes.

### Remote GDB using RSP server

Using an [RSP server](/lib/libriscv/rsp_server.hpp):

- Step through the code using GDB and your programs embedded pretty printers

### Build your own interpreter loop

- Using [CPU::step_one()](/lib/libriscv/cpu.hpp), one can step one instruction
- Precise simulation with custom conditions

### Using the DebugMachine wrapper

Using the [debugging wrapper](/lib/libriscv/debug.hpp):

- Simulate one instruction at a time
- Verbose instruction logging
- Debugger CLI with commands
- Pause simulation on arbitrary conditions

### Binary translation

The binary translation feature (accessible by enabling the `RISCV_BINARY_TRANSLATION` CMake option) can greatly improve performance in most cases, but requires compiling the program on the first run. The RISC-V binary is scanned for code blocks that are safe to translate, and then a C compiler is invoked on the generated code. This step takes a long time. The resulting code is then dynamically loaded and ready to use. It is also possible to cross-compile the binary translation for end-user systems, such as Windows. In other words, it's possible to ship a game with not just a sandboxed RISC-V program, but also a complementary binary translated .dll in order to reap heavy performance gains.

You can control binary translation by passing CC and CFLAGS environment variables to the program that runs the emulator. You can show the compiler arguments using VERBOSE=1. Example: `CFLAGS=-O2 VERBOSE=1 ./myemulator`. You may use `KEEPCODE=1` to preserve the generated code output from the translator for inspection. For the [CLI](/emulator), the `--no-translate` option can be used to disable binary translation in order to compare output or performance.

When embedded libtcc is enabled, by setting the CMake option `RISCV_LIBTCC` to `ON`, libriscv behaves like it's dynamically translated. _libriscv_ will invoke _libtcc_ on code generated for each execute segment, including those loaded from shared objects.


## Experimental and special features

### Read-write arena

The read-write arena simplifies memory operations immediately outside of the loaded ELF, leaving the heap unprotectable. If page protections are needed, pages can still be allocated outside of the arena memory area, and there page protections will apply as normal. It is default-enabled, providing a performance boost. Disabling the read-write arena enables full virtual paging.

### Embedded libtcc

When binary translation is enabled with `RISCV_BINARY_TRANSLATION=ON`, the option `RISCV_LIBTCC` is also available. libtcc will be embedded in the RISC-V emulator and used as a JIT-compiler. It will give a handsome 2-5x performance boost compared to interpreter mode. It's currently known to work on Linux, FreeBSD, Windows, macOS and Android.

### Full binary translation as embeddable code

It is possible to generate C99 freestanding source files from a binary translated program, embed it in a project at some later time, and automatically load and utilize the binary translation at run-time. This feature makes it possible to use full binary translation on platforms where it is ordinarily not possible. If a RISC-V program is changed without generating new sources, the emulator will (intentionally) not find these embedded functions and instead fall back to other modes, eg. interpreter mode. Changing a RISC-V program requires regenerating the sources and rebuilding the final program. Due to not requiring dynamic linking or changing page permissions, this means that _libriscv_ supports high-performance emulation on all mobile and console systems, for final/shipped builds.

In order to test this feature, follow these instructions:
```sh
$ cd emulator
$ ./build.sh -b
$ ./rvlinux ~/github/coremark/coremark-rv32g_b -Qno coremark
$ ls *.cpp
coremark9C111F55.cpp
$ ./build.sh --embed coremark9C111F55.cpp
$ ./rvlinux -v ~/github/coremark/coremark-rv32g_b
* Loading program of size 75145 from 0x7584018cb000 to virtual 0x10000 -> 0x22589
* Program segment readable: 1 writable: 0  executable: 1
* Loading program of size 1864 from 0x7584018dd58c to virtual 0x2358c -> 0x23cd4
* Program segment readable: 1 writable: 1  executable: 0
libriscv: Found embedded translation for hash 9C111F55, 13/1871 mappings
...
CoreMark 1.0 : 37034.750941 / GCC13.2.0 -O3 -DPERFORMANCE_RUN=1   / Static
```

- The original RISC-V binary is still needed, as it is treated as the ultimate truth by the emulator
- If the RISC-V program changes, the emulator will not use the outdated embedded code and instead fall back to another emulation mode, eg. interpreter mode
- Many files can be embedded allowing for dynamic executables to be embedded, with all their dependencies
- The configuration settings of libriscv are added to the hash of the filename, so in order to use the generated code on other systems and platforms the configurations must match exactly
- Embedded segments can be re-used by many emulators, for high scalability

### Experimental unbounded 32-bit addressing

It is possible to map out the entire 32-bit address space such that memory operations no longer require bounds-checking. This mode usually goes with features like userfaultfd, however currently only the address space is created, fully readable and writable. This means the feature should not be used when sandboxing is necessary, and instead it makes more sense currently for running CLI applications from the terminal. It can be enabled with `RISCV_EXPERIMENTAL` and then `RISCV_ENCOMPASSING_ARENA`. Both 64-bit and 32-bit programs are supported.

The feature is not restricted to just 32-bit address spaces. It can be configured by setting `RISCV_ENCOMPASSING_ARENA_BITS` to something other than 32. 32 is the fastest as addresses are replaced with 32-bit casts. For other N-bit address spaces, and-masking is used. For example, the bit value `27` represents a 128MB address space, and 33 is an 8GB address space.


### Interpreter performance settings

When binary translation is enabled, all emulator settings have roughly the same performance. However, when in interpreter mode (eg. on devices where loading shared objects is not allowed), there are a few ways to reliably improve performance.

Disabling the C-extension increases interpreter speed by ~20-25%, but requires a custom RISC-V toolchain. [Here's how to create one](/docs/NEWLIB.md). There are technical reasons for this, and it will not get better over time.

The C-extension can be disabled by setting the RISCV_EXT_C CMake option to OFF:

```sh
cd build
cmake .. -DRISCV_EXT_C=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

Other build options that aid performance: Enabling link-time optimizations. Using the latest and greatest compiler version. Enabling all the native accelerated system calls. Enabling the read-write arena (default ON). Enabling experimental features, like 32-bit unbounded address space. Unrolling loops in the sandboxed program.

Ultimately, all those settings will only increase performance by ~30-35% at most. For final builds, even on console and mobile systems, an [embedded binary translated code file](#full-binary-translation-as-embeddable-code) should be used to enable full binary translation performance. It doesn't require dynamic linking or changing page permissions on the system, as it is just a code file you add to your project. Full binary translation can easily increase performance up to 20x.


## Game development examples

There is a simple [step-by-step gamedev example](/examples/gamedev) under the examples folder. There are also examples for the C++, Rust, Nelua and Nim languages.

For a more complete and thorough implementation, have a look at [RVScript](https://github.com/fwsGonzo/rvscript). It embeds libriscv in a tiny example game framework and automatically builds fully functional C++ programs for ultra low-latency scripting.
